## Welcome

Creating user adaptive interfaces workshop - Google IO.

In this workshop we learned to use CSS to respect already pre-defined user preferences when rendering web pages.

In this workshop several new CSS properties were used that make for more concise stylesheets. Focused initially on adaptive interactions (allowing for Gamepad + KB, mouse and touch, plus screen readers); layout (using CSS grid and logical properties for internationally adaptive layouts); color (using HSL, adapt to dark/light preferences and accessibility) and subtle animations (adapting to the user's motion preferences).

Specific properties or tricks have been commented for future reference.
